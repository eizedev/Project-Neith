# About
Scripts in this folder will be used to collect data on a scheduled basis from various data sources. These will need to be imported in to various schedulers such as `cron` or `task scheduler`. Some changes will need to be made to the various scripts to ensure they point to the correct data sources and use valid credentials.

This document will guide you throug the necessary configurations for each scheduled task file.
