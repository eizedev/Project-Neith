# OTX API Notes
Most of these API requests will work without authentication. However it's worth using an API key, as it allows 10,000 requests per hour rather than just 1,000 requests per hour. Exceeding 10,000 requests per hour is normally fine so long as you let us know in advance. You can also use the API key to choose to only get data from users you have said you trust.
